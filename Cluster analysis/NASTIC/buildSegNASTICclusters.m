function [clusterData, boundaryVertexArray] = buildSegNASTICclusters(trackArray, overlapGroups, overlapThreshold)
% buildSegNASTICclusters groups tracks into clusters based their overlapping segments.
%
% Syntax:
%   [clusterData, boundaryVertexArray] = segNASTIC(trackArray, overlapGroups, overlapThreshold)
%
% Input Arguments:
%   (Required)
%   trackArray         Particle trajectories as a cell array. Each cell (track) has at least three
%                      columns, in the order [frame, x-coordinate, y-coordinate] and at least three
%                      rows (localizations).
%                      (:,1) cell
%
%   overlapGroups      Grouped indices as a cell array. Each cell indexes into |trackArray| to
%                      collect all tracks whose bounding boxes were overlapping. Cells with singular
%                      entries contain the non-overlapping remnants.
%                      (:,1) cell
%
%   overlapThreshold   Determines how often one track segment has to overlap with segments of
%                      other tracks to be considered as part of a cluster. Overlap here refers to
%                      the segment bounding boxes.
%                      (1,1) double
%
% Output Arguments:
%   clusterData        Data calculated for each cluster as a Nx3 list, with columns
%                      1: area in nmÂ² (all input data is assumed to be in nm),
%                      2: diameter in nm,
%                      3: number of tracks assigned to the cluster (by their centroids).
%                      4: x position of the cluster's centroid in nm,
%                      5: y position of the cluster's centroid in nm.
%                      (:,3) double
%
%   boundaryVertexArray   Indices for each cluster that provide their sorted border vertices. The
%                         points these indices refer to can be generated directly from |trackArray|:
%                         cell2mat(cellfun(@(x) x(:,2:3), trackArray, 'UniformOutput', false));
%                         (:,1) cell

% Subfunctions: mustBeTracksArray
% Additional required MATLAB products: none
